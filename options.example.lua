    CONFIGURATION FILE
    ================================================================

    This is a Lua file (.lua). Lua is a lightweight scripting
    language used to configure this mod's settings.

    HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
    1. Only change the values AFTER the equals sign (=).
    2. Numbers (like 1.0 or 2375) can be changed to your liking.
    3. Booleans (true or false) must stay lowercase.

    ABOUT COMMENTS:
    - Text starting with "--" is a single-line comment.
    - Text between "--[ [" and "] ]" is a multi-line comment.
    (Note: Spaces were added above to prevent syntax errors,
    in reality there are no spaces between the brackets).

    - Comments are IGNORED by the game. They are only here to
      provide instructions or remind you of the "Game defaults."
    - You can use comments to take notes for yourself!

    TIPS:
    - You can "comment out" specific lines to make the mod ignore
      them. If a line is commented out, the mod will use the
      game's original value instead.

      Example:
      LimitedMovementEncumbrance = {
        -- MaxSpeedMultiplier = 1.0,  <-- This line will be ignored
        bSprintingSuppressed = false, <-- This line will be applied
      }
